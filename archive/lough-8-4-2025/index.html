      <h1>A new approach in non-standard set theory: The counterfrumentous reals</h1>

      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p style="line-height: 2.4;">
        While the reals have served their purpose for decades—if not millenia—there comes a point
        in which less-standard approaches must be used to solve those unconventional problems with
        which modern mathematicians are faced daily. This paper proposes and will attempt to
        motivate a new alternative: the counterfrumentous reals, a commutative field whose merit
        across math and physics will be explored in the conclusion of this paper. Evidence suggests
        a ready understanding of this system has mathematic merit and may have a marked impact on
        discovery, implementation, and computation times for certain well-suited problems, as well
        as a not-insignificant impact on broader scopes.
