      <h1>About DayCarteXYZ</h1>
      <p style="padding: 20px; background-color: #fdd; border-radius: 10px;">
        <b>DayCarteXYZ is currently hiring!</b> We are looking for translators capable of writing in
        Spanish or French, who are fluenct in math and technical language. If you aren’t a
        translator, that’s OK too; we are willing to hire anyone with a passion for math and
        learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        DayCarteXYZ is a burgeoning math news site based in Cleavland, Ohio. It was founded by
        members Sam Parks and Michael Adams, and currently employs three author/editors, one
        proofreader and one designated researcher. Through DayCarteXYZ, we hope to spread knowledge
        and a love of niche and unusual new math developments.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are dedicated to providing high-quality articles with a special focus on math news that
        hasn’t yet been reported. Any interesting new development we come across will be considered,
        no matter how inconsequential. If you think you know of a good candidate for one of our
        articles that we have not covered, we will gladly consider your suggestion.
